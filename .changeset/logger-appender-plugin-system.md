Logging dispatches each entry to a registry of appenders. Available sinks: a console appender (logger pkg), a Node file appender (node-adapters), and a SQLite appender (`DbLogAppender` in core). Remote log shipping is a separate service that reads from the `logs` table — its toggle does not affect local persistence. Appenders support `pause` / `resume` for iOS suspension and a synchronous pre-suspend RAM flush.
